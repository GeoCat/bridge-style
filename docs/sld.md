# SLD 

[Styled Layer Descriptor](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld) is a standard from OGC to define the apearence of maps. SLD can be used to override the default apprearence of a WMS getmap request. Various server products, such as [Geoserver](https://geoserver.org) and [deegree](https://deegree.org) use SLD to define apearence of maps in WMS services.

GeoServer has implemented a series of [vendor parameters](https://docs.geoserver.org/master/en/user/styling/sld/extensions) on top of the SLD standard to facilitate additional appearence options.
