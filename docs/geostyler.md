# GeoStyler style

The [GeoStyler style](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-style) specification was originally developed by Terrestris in the scope of their [Geostyler](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler) product. The main task of the format is to be an exchange format for all the other standards. It should be capable of storing the styling possibilities of SLD, OpenLayers-Styles, MapBox-Styles, CartoCSS (and others) while being easily read- and writable.

Style-to-style uses the GeoStyler-style format as an intermediate format.
