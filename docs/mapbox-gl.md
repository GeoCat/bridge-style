# MapBox GL

[Mapbox style](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec) defines the visual appearance of Mapbox GL maps: what data to draw, the order to draw it in, and how to style the data when drawing it. Mapbox style is based on JSON. Mapbox style is commonly used to style [vector tiles](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/specification/).
